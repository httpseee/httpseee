### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**httpseee/httpseee** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm Setare Tohidi, a master student in Neuroscience who LOVES Computational Neuroscience! Hence, I've been studying mathematical tehories of Machine Learning for two years :D

My Bachelor's degree was in Biomedical Engineering, and my Bachelor's thesis was "Segmentation and Visualization of Brain MRI Data in Virtual Reality". I used a Convolutional Neural Network to segment brain MRI Data into eight regions, then I made a 3D model of segmented regions and developed a vitrual reality environment where I could visualize the segmented 3D regions in that.

In my Master, I'm using optogenetics method to study the behaviour of Neuromodulators in neuocortex, in a task related to Learning and Memory.
- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on "The Role of NeuroModulators in Learning and Memory"
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to Computational Neuroscience
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: My Twitter account is @setaretohidi
- âš¡ Fun fact: I run every day and I dearm of running a Marathon! :D
