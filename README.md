### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Setare Tohidi, a master student in Neuroscience :)  I've been studying mathematical tehories of Machine Learning for past two years :D

I have a B.sc. in Biomedical Engineering, and my Bachelor's thesis was "Segmentation and Visualization of Brain MRI Data in  A Virtual Reality Environmetn". I used a Convolutional Neural Network to segment brain MRI Data into eight regions, then I made a 3D model of segmented regions and developed a vitrual reality environment where I could visualize the segmented 3D regions in that.

In my Master, I'm using optogenetics method to study the behaviour of Neuromodulators in neuocortex, in a task related to Learning and Memory.
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on "The Role of NeuroModulators in Learning and Memory"
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects related to Computational Neuroscience
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: My Twitter account is @setaretohidi
- âš¡ Fun fact: I run every day and I dearm of running a Marathon! :D
